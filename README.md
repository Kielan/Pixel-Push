## How to Contribute

### Requirements

You must have node.js and git installed.

You also need `npm` in version 7 (because of 2nd version of lockfile which was introduced there) which comes with Node.js 15 or newer. To simplify installation of proper versions you can make use of [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) and run `nvm install` â€“ it will activate proper Node.js version in your current command prompt session.

### Feature Toggles

Some feature might be hidden by default. Functions to enable/disable them are available inside global `featureToggles` and operate on a `window.localStorage`.

For example use `featureToggles.enableEllipseTool()` to make ellipse tool button visible. Then `featureToggles.disableEllipseTool()` to hide it.
